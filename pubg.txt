PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (also known as PUBG: Battlegrounds) is an online multiplayer battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of Bluehole. The game is based on previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction.
